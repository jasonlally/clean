Hello Matt! I was racking my brain on what I could get you for your birthday and I wanted to make something this year. So...I thought as you get ready to finish up school and you think about next steps, why not have your own corner on the web.

Now, there's no obligation to use this, but if you want, all the source code is available (I just cloned a theme someone already made with some very light modification). Also, I obviously purchased http://mattdilbeck.com which I would love to transfer to you if you want it. If not, I'll put it on the market and see if I can sell it to the highest bidding Matt Dilbeck ;-)

You should feel free to do whatever you want with your corner. But I hope you can post your creative works, writings, musings here, but really you should do whatever you want with it.

If you do nothing with it, and I hope you do, well then it's still a fancy digital birthday card made with love.

I hope your next year is filled with great opportunities and fullfillment.

Yours,

Jason
