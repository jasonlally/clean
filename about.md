This site is slightly customized based on a [jekyll theme](https://github.com/knaman2609/clean) created by [@knaman2609](https://github.com/knaman2609).

The code for this [site can be found here](https://github.com/jasonlally/matts-birthday). I stood up this site to celebrate my friend Matt's birthday. He just turned 33! We met one blustery night in Denver (I don't think it was actually blustery, but that's how I'll choose to remember it). Ever since, through ups and downs and lefts and rights, Matt's been a good friend. I always wish him the best!

P.S.
